# Sample Dashboard

Open the Amazon CloudWatch console. In the navigation pane, choose **Dashboards** and press **Create dashboard** to setup a new custom dashboard.  
Instead of adding a widget, select *+Actions** and choose **View/edit source**.  
Copy and paste the contents of this [json](../assets/dashboard.json) file.

**Note:** You'll now need to adjust the SID (**HDB**), region (**eu-central-1**) as well as EC2 InstanceIds manually to fit your environment.

If done, press either **Preview** or **Update**.
